  I work on controlling plant developmental programs using light, hormones, and genome engineering,
  with a focus on high-value crops such as cucumber and strawberry. My research aims to make
  regeneration-dependent technologies—such as gene editing and controlled-environment propagation—
  reliable across elite cultivars.
