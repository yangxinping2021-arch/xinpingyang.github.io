I work on controlling plant developmental programs using light, hormones, and genome engineering, with a focus on high-value crops such as cucumber and strawberry. My research aims to make regeneration-dependent technologies—such as gene editing, speed breeding, and synthetic seeds—reliable across elite cultivars.
