Wild cucumber relatives offer a rich and largely untapped source of genetic diversity for innovating cucumber breeding. As the wild progenitor of cultivated cucumber, Cucumis hardwickii harbors valuable traits for stress tolerance, disease resistance, and developmental flexibility that were diminished during domestication. Harnessing these traits through modern breeding and biotechnological approaches can accelerate the development of resilient, high-performing cucumber cultivars for future agriculture.
